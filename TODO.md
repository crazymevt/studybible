# TODO

Running list of known issues and follow-ups.

## Bugs

- [x] **Right-click dictionary lookup returns multiple words instead of the
  exact word.** Right-clicking (or long-pressing) a word in the reader to "Look
  up in Dictionary" showed every entry containing the term as a substring.
  - Fixed: `dictionarySearchQueryProvider` now carries an `exact` flag; the
    reader lookups request an exact (case-insensitive) headword match and show
    "No definitions found" when there's no exact headword (no substring
    fallback). The free-text search box keeps its substring behaviour.

## Enhancements

- [x] **Start TTS (read-aloud) from the selected verse, not the chapter
  beginning.** When a verse is selected, read-aloud now begins at the first
  selected verse instead of restarting from verse 1.
  - Fixed: `TtsController.toggle` forwards a `fromVerse` to `start`; the read
    aloud sheet seeds it from the lowest `selectedVersesProvider` entry (0 when
    nothing is selected) and shows "Starts at verse N" while idle. Pause/resume
    still continues where it left off.
